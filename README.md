# Light dimmer over home internet

This is the phase one of the project that I Developed before.

This is a project developed through many programming languages, JavaScript, html, Python, CSS.
It is supported by Raspberry pi 3, which is a very small and usefull computer, you can use its hardware to control things and read sensors as well.

If you take a look, you can find some files.

To make it works, you should install into Raspberry a web server called Webiopi.

Now I'm working to inprove the user interface to make it feel more confortable and auto-adjustable to use in Smart devices.
